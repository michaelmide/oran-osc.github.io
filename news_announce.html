          The O-RAN Alliance and Linux Foundation Launch Industry-Leading O-RAN Open Source Community<br>
          <i>New Initiative Fosters Collaboration with Adjacent Open Source Networking Communities</i></h5>
          </p>

        <div class="text-left">
          <p>
Today, the O-RAN Alliance (<a href="www.o-ran.org" target=_blank>www.o-ran.org"</a>) and the Linux Foundation (<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org" target=blank>https://www.linuxfoundation.org</a>) jointly announced the creation of the O-RAN Software Community (O-RAN SC) (www.o-ran-sc.org).</p>

         <p>
The telecom industry is experiencing a profound transformation and 5G is expected to radically change how we live, work, and play.  This means it’s critical to make network infrastructure commercially available as quickly as possible to ensure business success for operators. It’s time to turn to open source, as it is one of the most efficient ways to accelerate product development in a collaborative and cost-efficient way.</p>

         <p>The O-RAN SC will provide open software aligned with the O-RAN Alliance’s open architecture. As a new open source community under the Linux Foundation, the O-RAN SC is sponsored by the O-RAN Alliance, and together they will develop open source software enabling modular, open, intelligent, efficient, and agile disaggregated radio access networks.  The initial set of software projects may include: near-real-time RAN intelligent controller (nRT RIC), non-real-time RAN intelligent controller (NRT RIC), cloudification and virtualization platforms, open central unit (O-CU), open distributed unit (O-DU), and a test and integration effort to provide a working reference implementation.  Working with other adjacent open source networking communities, the O-RAN SC will enable collaborative development across the full operator network stack.</p>

         <p>“This collaboration between the O-RAN Alliance and the Linux Foundation is a tremendous accomplishment that represents the culmination of years of thoughtful innovation around the next generation of networks,” said Andre Fuetsch, Chairman of the O-RAN Alliance, and President of AT&T Labs and Chief Technology Officer at AT&T. “The launch of the O-RAN SC marks the next phase of that innovation, where the benefits of disaggregated and software-centric platforms will move out to the edge of the network. This new open source community will be critical if 5G is to reach its full potential.”</p>

        <p>"We are really excited to see the establishment of the O-RAN Open Source Community," said Chih-Lin I, Chief Scientist of China Mobile, co-chair of the O-RAN Technical Steering Committee and member of the Executive Committee of the O-RAN Alliance. "The O-RAN Alliance is aiming at building an ‘Open' and ‘Smart' Radio Access Network for future wireless systems. From day one, the Alliance has embraced open source as one of the most powerful means to achieve its vision.  The O-RAN Open Source Community is the fruit of a yearlong extensive deliberation between the O-RAN Alliance and the Linux Foundation. We believe that the power of open source will further the momentum and accelerate the development, test, commercialization and deployment of O-RAN solutions.”</p>

        <p>“We are excited to collaborate with O-RAN Alliance in bringing communities together to create software for this important access area of Telecommunications,” said Arpit Joshipura, GM Networking, Edge & IOT, the Linux Foundation. “This step towards execution marks another major milestone in networking partnerships across standards and open source organizations.”</p>

        <p><strong><i>About O-RAN Alliance</i></strong><br>
The O-RAN Alliance is a world-wide, carrier-led effort to drive new levels of openness in the radio access network of next generation wireless systems. Future RANs will be built on a foundation of virtualized network elements, white-box hardware and standardized interfaces that fully embrace O-RAN’s core principles of intelligence and openness. An ecosystem of innovative new products is already emerging that will form the underpinnings of the multi-vendor, interoperable, autonomous RAN, envisioned by many in the past, but only now enabled by the global industry-wide vision, commitment and leadership of O-RAN Alliance members and contributors.<br>

        <p><strong><i>About the Linux Foundation</i></strong><br>
Founded in 2000, the Linux Foundation is supported by more than 1,000 members and is the world's leading home for collaboration on open source software, open standards, open data, and open hardware. Linux Foundation's projects are critical to the world's infrastructure including Linux, Kubernetes, Node.js, and more.    The Linux Foundation's methodology focuses on leveraging best practices and addressing the needs of contributors, users and solution providers to create sustainable models for open collaboration.
